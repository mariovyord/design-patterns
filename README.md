# Design Patterns Examples

This repository contains examples of classic design patterns implemented in TypeScript. Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design that help create more maintainable and flexible code.

## Pattern Categories

### Creational Patterns

- **Abstract Factory** - Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Factory Method** - Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Builder** - Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.
- **Singleton** - Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Structural Patterns

- **Adapter** - Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.
- **Decorator** - Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.
- **Facade** - Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

### Behavioral Patterns

- **Observer** - Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
- **Strategy** - Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.
